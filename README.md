# fc5-convert-cli

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/.

I like using both Fight Club 5 and Game Master 5 (more the former than the latter these days, because Roll20..), and for the game I run, I like being able to control/rebuild what is visible and in the compendium for my players (e.g. to constrain sources).

I also use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to keep track of my notes. The goal is to use the same filtered resources as a reference both in my local notes (Obsidian) and in Fight Club 5 (Players).

## To build (optional)

1. Clone this repository
2. Build this project: `quarkus build` or `./mvnw install`
3. `java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar --help`

## To run without building yourself

1. Install JBang: https://www.jbang.dev/documentation/guide/latest/installation.html
2. Install the snapshot jar: 
```
jbang app install --name fc5-convert --force --fresh https://jitpack.io/dev/ebullient/fc5-convert-cli/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
```
3. Run the command: 
```
fc5-convert --help
```

## Starting with 5eTools JSON data

```
fc5-convert 5etools --help
```

An example invocation (based on sources I own): 

```
fc5-convert 5etools --xml --md --index -o dm dm-sources.json ~/git/dnd/5etools-mirror-1.github.io/data wbtw-items.json
```

- `--xml` Create FightClub 5 Compendium XML files (compendium.xml and files per type)
- `--md` Create Obsidian Markdown from [Templates](#templates)
- `--index` Create `all-index.json` containing all of the touched artifact ids, and `src-index.json` that shows the filtered/allowed artifact ids. These are useful when tweaking exclude rules (as shown below).
- `-o dm` The target output directory. All of the above files will be created in this directory.

The rest of the command-line specifies input files: 

- `dm-sources.json` Parsing parameters (shown in detail below)
- `~/git/dnd/5etools-mirror-1.github.io/data` Path to the data directory of the 5eTools mirror
- `wbtw-items.json` Custom items

### Additional parameters

Additional instructions for dealing with 5etools data can be supplied in a json file like this (based on sources I own): 

```json
{
  "from": [
    "AI",
    "PHB",
    "DMG",
    "TCE",
    "XGE",

    "SCAG",
    "EGW",
    "FS",
    "MaBJoV",

    "AWM",
    "CM",
    "LMoP",
    "ESK",
    "DIP",
    "SLW",
    "SDW",
    "DC",
    "IDRotF",
    "PotA",
    "EEPC",
    "GoS",
    "OoW",
    "TftYP",
    "TftYP-AtG",
    "TftYP-DiT",
    "TftYP-TFoF",
    "TftYP-THSoT",
    "TftYP-TSC",
    "TftYP-ToH",
    "TftYP-WPM",
    "WBtW",
    "WDH",
    "WDMM",

    "FTD",
    "MM",
    "MTF",
    "VGM"
  ],
  "paths": {
    "rules": "/compendium/rules/"
  },
  "excludePattern": [
    "race|.*|dmg"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "monster|expert|dc",
    "monster|expert|sdw",
    "monster|expert|slw"
  ]
}
```

- `from` defines the array of all sources. If you omit from (and don't specify any other sources on the command line), only SRD items are included. Only include items from sources you own.
- `paths` allows you to specify that path that should be used in cross-document links, and to find conditions, and weapon/item properties. Used only when generating Markdown. By default, items, spells, monsters, backgrounds, races, and classes are in `/compendium/`, while files defining conditions and properties are in `/rules/`.
- `exclude` and `excludePattern` work against identifiers that can be found in the generated index files. They allow you to further tweak/constrain what is emitted. In the above example, I'm excluding all of the race variants from the DMG, and the monster-form of the expert sidekick from the Essentials Kit.

To generate player-focused compendiums for The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, I've constrained things. 
I am pulling from a much smaller set of sources overall. I included Elemental Evil Player's Companion (Genasi) and Volo's Guide to Monsters (Tabaxi), but then added exclude patterns to remove elements from these sourcebooks that I don't want my players to see (yet): 

```json

```

## Starting with FightClub 5 XML data

1. Grab a copy of the FC5 XML repo: Clone https://github.com/kinkofer/FightClub5eXML

2. Look in the Collections directory of the Fight Club repository to see how collections work. Choose one of those or make your own.

3. Validate the Collection (against a built-in XML schema)
    - Using the built jar: 
      ```shell
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar validate --help
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar validate FightClub5eXML/Collections/CoreRulebooks.xml
      ```
    - Using the jbang installed alias: 
      ```shell
      fc5-convert validate --help
      fc5-convert validate FightClub5eXML/Collections/CoreRulebooks.xml
      ```    

4. Merge and transform the collected XML documents using XSLT 2.0 (a default xslt file is in src/main/resources):
    - Using the built jar: 
      ```shell
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar transform --help
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar transform -o target -x '-merged' FightClub5eXML/Collections/CoreRulebooks.xml
      ```
    - Using the jbang installed alias (notice `-o target` for the output directory): 
      ```shell
      fc5-convert transform --help
      fc5-convert transform -o target -x '-merged' FightClub5eXML/Collections/CoreRulebooks.xml
      ```
      
    This will create `target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml`

5. Convert the merged XML document to Obsidian markdown (basically CommonMark with YAML front-matter). For testing/tooling around purposes, you can tool around with test files (notice `-o target/reference` for the output directory). 
    - Using the built jar: 
      ```shell
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar obsidian --help
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar obsidian \
        -o target/reference \
        src/test/resources/backgroundAcolyte.xml
      java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar obsidian \
        -o target/reference \
        target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
      ```
    - Using the jbang installed alias: 
      ```shell
      fc5-convert obsidian --help
      fc5-convert obsidian \
        -o target/reference \
        target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
      ```    

6. Export items to CSV (notice `-o target` for the output directory)
   - Using the built jar:
     ```shell
     java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar \
         transform -o target -x .csv \
         -t src/main/resources/itemExport.xslt \
         target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
     ```
   - Using the jbang installed alias :
     ```shell
     fc5-convert transform -o target -x .csv \
       -t src/main/resources/itemExport.xslt \
       target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
     ```    

## Qute Markdown templates

This applicaiton uses the [Qute Templating Engine](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute). Simple customizations to markdown output can be achieved by copying a template from src/main/resources/templates, making the desired modifications, and then specifying that template on the command line.
    
```shell
java -jar target/fc5-convert-cli-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar obsidian \
  --background src/main/resources/templates/background2md.txt \
  -o target/reference target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
```
OR
```shell
fc5-convert obsidian \
  --background src/main/resources/templates/background2md.txt \
  -o target/reference target/CoreRulebooks-merged.xml
```
